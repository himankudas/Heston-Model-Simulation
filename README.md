# Heston Model Simulation

## Discription  
This repository represents the simulation of Heston Model on Python.

We will need the following Libraries that will need to be imported.

1. numpy
2. seaborn    
3. matplotlib
4. py_vollib_vectorized


This program is implemented in [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/). 

### Introduction:

The main advantage of Heston Model over Black Scholes Merthon Model to Price options is that unlike the Black Scholes Merthon Model, heston Model does not assume constant volatility. 

Heston model is used  for simulating stochastic volatility and the effect of stochastic volatility  on the expected paths an asset price  can take over the life of an option. 

It also Incorporates the effect of leverage while pricing the option, and there is no risk of negative variance. This makes the Heston Model more effective.
